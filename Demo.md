# Demo

**Note: the demo data set is shared between anybody testing against it. It will be reset to its original state periodically. As it is an open data set running on limited resources, please treat it nicely!**

## Demo credentials

We've gone crazy with trust here, and provide a single test user with password for general demo and testing purposes.

Note that once you decide to start serious integration work, you should get a dedicated integration test client (tenant) and a dedicated user for working with it from the Contracting integration team. See [Getting started](Getting%20started.md) for details.

User name: demo@email.com  
Password: ContractingRocks!

Long lasting bearer token for testing: ***TODO***
