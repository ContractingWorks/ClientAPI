**Note: the demo data set is shared between everyone testing against it. It will be periodically reset to its original state. As it is an open data set running on limited resources, please treat it nicely!**

## Demo credentials
Contact contracting works support for a demo user to access the [demo client](https://contracting-extest-front.azurewebsites.net/client/b-dummydata/).

Note that, once you decide to start serious integration work, you should get a dedicated integration test client (tenant) and a dedicated user for working with it from the Contracting integration team. See [Getting started](Getting%20started.md) for details.
