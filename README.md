# Contracting.Works integrations

***Under heavy construction***

Documentation and examples for using the Contracting.Works APIs

## Demo

The APIs can be tested on dummy data using standardized credentials using GraphQL Playground and Swagger. [See Demo](Demo.md).

**Note: the demo data set is shared between anybody testing against it. It will be reset to its original state periodically. As it is an open data set running on limited resources, please treat it nicely!**

## Getting started

To get started quickly with integrations, we have created a simple guide [located here](Getting%20started.md).

## Documentation

Documentation is located in the Doc subfolder. A good starting points is [the documentation readme](Doc/README.md).

## Example code

Runnable example code in .Net reading and writing data to our demo client is located in the [Examples](Examples/README.md) subfolder in this repo.
