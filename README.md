# Contracting.Works integrations

***Under heavy construction***

Documentation and examples for using the Contracting.Works APIs

## Demo

The APIs can be tested on dummy data using standardized credentials using Banana Cake Pop and Swagger. [See Demo](Demo.md).

**Note: the demo data set is shared between everyone testing against it. It will be periodically reset to its original state. As it is an open data set running on limited resources, please treat it nicely!**

## Getting started

To get started quickly with integrations, we have created a [simple getting started guide](Getting%20started.md).

## Read & Write sample app

See the [Read & Write sample app](Examples/ReadAndWrite/README.md) on how to read data from Contracting Works using GraphQL and update it using REST.i

## Documentation

Documentation is located in the [Doc subfolder](Doc).

## Example code

Runnable example code in .Net reading and writing data to our demo client is located in the [Examples](Examples) subfolder in this repo.
